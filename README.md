# Real-Time-Face-Detection-with-OpenCV
=====================================

Overview:
---------
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces in each frame using a Haar Cascade classifier, and highlights them with bounding boxes.

It’s a great starting point for building more advanced computer vision applications like emotion detection, face recognition, or attendance systems.

Features:
---------
- Real-time video capture from webcam
- Face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier
- Visual bounding boxes around detected faces
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

---

Technologies Used:
------------------
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Haar Cascade XML files for face detection

Installation:
-------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Time-Face-Detection-with-OpenCV.git
   cd Real-Time-Face-Detection-with-OpenCV

2. Install the required packages:
   pip install opencv-python

3. Run the script:
   python face_detection.py

Note: Ensure your webcam is working and accessible.

How It Works:
-------------
- The webcam feed is captured using OpenCV’s `VideoCapture`.
- Each frame is converted to grayscale for faster processing.
- Haar Cascade Classifier is used to detect faces in the frame.
- Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles in real-time.

---

Future Improvements:
--------------------
- Add face recognition (e.g., with OpenCV LBPH or face_recognition library)
- Save snapshots of detected faces
- Integrate with GUI (Tkinter or PyQt)
- Detect multiple features like eyes, smiles, etc.
